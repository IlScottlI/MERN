# Looking Ahead
Congratulations! You have just been able to make your first CRUD MERN application! That is a big accomplishment. 

Although we have some great functionality, you may have noticed that our application is not exactly perfect. In fact, it is far from it. It is a working application, but the user experience can be updated. There are some ways we can change the design of our React front end in order to make it better for users as well as easier to maintain for developers. The next section will focus on cleaning up our code with some more advanced MERN design patterns.
