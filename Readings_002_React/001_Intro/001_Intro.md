# What is React?
**"A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"**

**- https://reactjs.org**

React is going to be the code that runs on our user's browser, displaying the information we want them to see, reacting to user input, being responsible for not just the look and feel of our web app but most of its interactivity as well.

## Where does React come from?

React is an open-source project maintained by Facebook and they release it under the permissive MIT license. Along with Angular and Vue, it is one of the most popular front end frameworks being used today.

## Why should we learn React?

*   React can be used to build a single page application or SPA, which will make our website feel more responsive by eliminating page loads for our users
*   React isn't opinionated about what technology we use with it, we can choose the libraries we use for: http requests, front-end routing, styling, etc
*   React doesn't prevent us from using DOM manipulation already built into JavaScript
*   React is popular (there are more weekly downloads on NPM for React than for Angular or Vue)
*   In the [2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology) (a fun read if we have the time)
    *   React has overtaken Angular/Angular.js in usage (only behind jQuery)
    *   React is the most loved web framework by its developers narrowly edging out Vue
