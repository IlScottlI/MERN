# Intro to Rest APIs
What is an API? Technically speaking, API stands for Application Programming Interface. This sounds a little mysterious, so let's dig into it a little more. If you have a program, you may want it to communicate with another program that is written in a different technology, tech stack, etc. So, generally speaking, an API is the interface that allows one program/application to communicate with another. Think of it as a bridge. You can have two separate terrains, but an API is the bridge between the two.

Many times you will hear the term "RESTful API" or "REST API." A RESTful API, specifically, is an API that communicates among and between web services. These APIs follow a certain set of rules that make sure it is easy for people to implement them. By following a consistent set of conventions, learning different RESTful APIs will become quite easy and streamlined.
