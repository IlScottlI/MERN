# Functional vs. Class Components
Using React, we can build components as either classes or functions. Historically, class components have been the way to go. Class components were more robust, and had the ability to handle things such as state. Functional components did not have state directly tied to them, whereas class components had them as an attribute.

With the creation of hooks, we can now access component state in a functional component. Class components have slowly been overtaken by functional components, and most new React code will likely use functional components. The React team has stated that they are still going to support class components. You can mix and match them and the code will still work. Going forward, due to the increasing relevance of functional components we will be using them exclusively. However, understanding class components is extremely important, as hooks are relatively new, and many existing codebases will still use class components.
